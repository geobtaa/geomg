# frozen_string_literal: true

# Constants for various controlled lists for Document attributes.
#
# _Removing_ values from here may require data migration in your existing db.
#
# ## Display lables via i18n
# These are the values actually stored in the DB. Display-translated values can be
# provided via a poorly documented built-in feature of Rails i18n.
#
# If you put an I18n value in your locale file (eg config/locales/en.yml) at:
#     activerecord:
#       attributes:
#         work/format:
#           image: "Really great image"
#
# Then you can look it up with Work.human_attribute_name("format.image"). It even
# does some superclass lookup for you if you have an inheritance hieararchy.
#
# ## Some lists elsewhere
# Controlled values for specific sub-model classes (like Creator) can be found
# within them, not here. This is only for primitive attributes on Work. (But should
# we move sub-model lists here too?)
